This is a circuit implementing basic operation of an elevator in a 2-story building.

The finite state machine has 1 input.
1. enable (enables operation of elevator)

There are 3 outputs.
1. door
2. moving
3. current floor

When the user sets the enable input, the elevator should perform the following sequence:
*open the door for 4 secounds
*close the door
*move the elevator to the destination floor in 4 seconds and sisplay the current floor number using an LED
*open the door for 4 secounds
*close the door
*go to idle state

Some conditions are...
*remain in the same floor if enable input is reset and repeat the sequence if the enable input is set
*the elevator will complete the sequence if enable signal is reset in the middle of the sequence
*assume that the clock frequency is 4 Hz

On the circuit,
*LED on the bottom left shows the state of the door. On=open, Off=close
*LED on the bottom middle shows if the elevator is moving or not. On=moving, Off=idle
*LED on the bottom right shows which floor the elevator is at. On=1st floor, Off=2nd floor
